// Extend the user story 4 to further develop the OOPS Banner Application by
// not only using String arrays to hold banner lines and printing them in a
// loop. But also by defining and populating the array in a more concise way
// at the time of declaration using String.join() method to create each line
// of the banner.

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Each line represents a row in the banner for the letters O, O, P, S
        String[] lines = {
			String.join(" ","  *****  ","  *****  ","  ****** ","  ****** "),

			String.join(" "," **   ** "," **   ** "," **      ","       **"),
			String.join(" "," **   ** "," **   ** "," **      "," **    **"),
			String.join(" ","  *****  ","  *****  "," **      ","  ****** "),
            
        };

        // Use a loop to print each line of the banner to create the
        // visual effect for the message "OOPS"
